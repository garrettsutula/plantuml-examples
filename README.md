# PlantUML Examples
Practical examples of [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) diagrams. I also prefer to use an include file like [include.puml](./include.puml) in this repo to make diagrams monochrome by default.

## Domain Model
This domain model depicts a conceptual model of the data objects supporting a online store.

## Use Case
This use case diagram depicts the use cases supporting an online store.

## Activity
This activity diagram is intended to represent how messages in an event-driven architecture are handled, the sequence diagram below it may provide additional context.

## Deployment
This deployment diagram depicts a stateless system that's deployed across multiple physical locations & datacenters with master-master replication of the underlying database.

## Sequence
These sequence diagrams depict simple microservice CRUD operations with an underlying document database. 
### GET
